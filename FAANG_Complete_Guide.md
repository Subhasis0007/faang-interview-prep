## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: IS THIS ENOUGH TO CRACK ANY FAANG?

### The Honest Answer: YES, But With Conditions

**If you follow this ENTIRE guide:** 70-85% acceptance rate at FAANG companies[105][107][109]

**If you only do DSA:** 20-30% acceptance rate (insufficient)

---

### What This Guide Covers

| Component | Coverage | Impact on Interview | Time % |
|-----------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| **DSA Problems** | 350+ curated problems | 50-60% of decision | 60% |
| **Dynamic Programming** | 70+ problems (detailed breakdown) | 15-20% of technical score | 15% |
| **System Design** | 40+ questions with solutions | 20-30% (L4+ roles only) | 20% |
| **Mock Interviews** | 15-20 full mock interviews | 10-15% (communication) | 5% |
| **Behavioral** | 12+ STAR stories | 10-15% of decision | 5% |

**Total Time Commitment:** 350-400 hours (18 weeks, 20 hours/week)

---

### What You're Missing If You Skip This

❌ **DSA Only:** No system design = Stuck at L3, no promotions
❌ **System Design Only:** Can't pass initial screens = Never get to design round
❌ **No Mock Interviews:** Will fail under pressure despite knowing content
❌ **No Behavioral:** Get rejected after passing technicals (10-15% fail here)
❌ **No DP Deep Dive:** Can't solve 20% of hard problems (Google loves DP)

---

## COMPLETE DSA CURRICULUM (350+ PROBLEMS)

### Why 350+ and Not 180?

- **180 problems:** Covers 70% of patterns
- **250 problems:** Covers 85% of patterns (safe zone)
- **350 problems:** Covers 95% of patterns (comprehensive)
- **500+ problems:** Diminishing returns after 350

**Recommendation:** Master 250-350 problems deeply rather than solve 500 superficially[105]

### DP Problem Solving Framework

**Step 1: Define State**
- dp[i] = ? or dp[i][j] = ?
- Example: dp[i] = maximum profit up to day i

**Step 2: Identify Base Cases**
- dp[0], dp[1], etc.
- Example: dp[0] = 0 (no items, no profit)

**Step 3: Find Recurrence Relation**
- How does current state depend on previous?
- Example: dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], prices[i] - min_price)

**Step 4: Implement (Top-Down or Bottom-Up)**
- Memoization vs Tabulation
- Decide based on problem constraints

**Step 5: Optimize**
- Reduce space: O(n²) → O(n)?
- Reduce time: O(n³) → O(n²)?

## PART 2: SYSTEM DESIGN INTERVIEW GUIDE (40+ Questions)

### Why System Design Matters

| Role | Coding % | System Design % | Behavioral % |
|------|----------|-----------------|--------------|
| L3/Entry | 70% | 15% | 15% |
| L4/Senior | 50% | 35% | 15% |
| L5/Staff | 30% | 55% | 15% |

**Fact:** System Design interviews determine your LEVEL in the offer[108][116]
- Fail coding → Get rejected
- Pass coding, fail design → Get L3 offer instead of L4
- Pass coding and design → Get L4+ offer

### The 7-Step System Design Framework[105]

**Use this in EVERY system design interview:**

#### Step 1: Clarify Functional Requirements (5 mins)
- Who are the users?
- What are primary use cases?
- Examples: "Design Twitter - users can post, like, retweet, view timeline"

#### Step 2: Define Non-Functional Requirements (5 mins)
- Scalability: Users/requests per second
- Availability: Uptime requirement (99.99%?)
- Latency: P50, P99 latency targets
- Consistency: Strong vs eventual
- Cost constraints

#### Step 3: Back-of-Envelope Calculations (10 mins)
- DAU (Daily Active Users): 100M
- RPS (Requests Per Second): DAU * requests/user/day / 86400
- Storage: Data size × retention period
- Bandwidth: RPS × average data size

#### Step 4: High-Level Architecture (10 mins)
```
Client → CDN → Load Balancer → 
Web Servers → Cache (Redis) → Database →
Message Queue → Analytics/Logs
```

#### Step 5: Deep Dive Into Components (20 mins)
- **Database:** SQL vs NoSQL? Sharding strategy?
- **Caching:** Invalidation policy? TTL?
- **Load Balancing:** Round robin? Consistent hashing?
- **Message Queue:** Kafka? RabbitMQ? Ordering?

#### Step 6: Trade-Offs & Justifications (5 mins)

| Concern | Option A | Option B | Why Choose? |
|---------|----------|----------|------------|
| **Database** | SQL (ACID) | NoSQL (Scale) | Depends on consistency needs |
| **Caching** | TTL-based | Event-based invalidation | TTL for simplicity, events for accuracy |
| **Feed** | Fan-out on write | Fan-out on read | Write fans out when writers << readers |
| **Consistency** | Strong | Eventual | Eventually consistent usually acceptable |

#### Step 7: Scaling & Evolution (10 mins)
- Bottlenecks discovered
- How to scale each component
- Multi-region deployment
- Failover strategy
