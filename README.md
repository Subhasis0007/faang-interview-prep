# FAANG Interview Prep (C#) — Starter Repo

This repository is a structured workspace to solve problems from **FAANG_Complete_Guide.md** and publish to GitHub.

## What you get
- ✅ Ready-to-use folder structure
- ✅ C# solution templates (LeetCode-style + runnable project)
- ✅ Problem README template
- ✅ System design template
- ✅ Progress tracker **pre-filled** from the guide

## Recommended workflow
1. Pick a problem from `progress/progress-tracker.md`
2. Create a folder under the right topic: `dsa/<topic>/<####-problem-slug>/`
3. Add:
   - `README.md` (copy from `docs/problem-template.md`)
   - `Solution.cs` (copy from `docs/leetcode-solution-template.cs`)
4. Commit + push

## Running C# locally (optional)
You can also keep runnable code under `csharp/`:
- `csharp/src/InterviewPrep` contains a small console app.
- `csharp/tests/InterviewPrep.Tests` is an xUnit test project.

> Note: For online judges (LeetCode), prefer the LeetCode-style `public class Solution { ... }`.
