**Pattern:** Two pointers

## Question (in my own words)
Check if string is palindrome considering only alphanumeric and ignoring case.

## Best approach
Two pointers from both ends; skip non-alphanumeric; compare lowercase characters.

## Complexity
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

## C# Solution
See `Solution.cs`.
