# Univalued Binary Tree

    **Pattern:** DFS recursion

    ## Question (in my own words)
    Return true if every node in the tree has the same value.

    ## Best approach
    Capture root value, then DFS ensuring every node.val equals that value.

    ## Complexity
    - Time: O(n)
    - Space: O(h)

>     public int val;
>     public TreeNode left;
>     public TreeNode right;
>     public TreeNode(int val=0, TreeNode left=null, TreeNode right=null) {
>         this.val = val;
>         this.left = left;
>         this.right = right;
>     }
